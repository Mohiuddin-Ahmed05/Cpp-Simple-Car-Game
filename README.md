# C++ Simple Car Game

Top-down racing prototype built with **SDL2** and **SDL2_ttf**. It features a lightweight scene system (Menu, Options, Race) and a progressively harder endless highway where you dodge traffic, advance levels, and display HUD overlays rendered with TTF fonts.

---

## Requirements
- CMake 3.16+
- A C++17 compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
- SDL2 development files
- SDL2_ttf development files

On Debian/Ubuntu-based distros:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake gdb libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

---

## Build & Run
From the project root:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build -j
./build/game
```

Use `cmake --build build --target clean` to clean the build directory if needed.

---

## Controls
- **Global**
  - `Esc`: quit from Menu or return to Menu from any other scene
  - `Enter`: advance to the next race level or retry after crashing
- **Racing**
  - `W / Up`: accelerate
  - `S / Down`: brake
  - `A / Left`, `D / Right`: steer (diagonal movement auto-normalized)
- **Menu**
  - `W / Up` and `S / Down`: navigate options
  - `Enter`: confirm selection
- **Options**
  - `F`: toggle fullscreen
  - `R`: cycle windowed resolutions when not fullscreen

---

```

- `build/` is generated by CMake and holds the compiled binary (`build/game`).
- `versions/v*` folders mirror the project at earlier checkpoints for comparison or regression testing.

## Additional Notes
- See `docs/Setup.txt` for the full dependency list and command recap.
- `docs/Structure.md` dives deeper into the scene architecture if you plan to extend the project.
- Fonts live in `assets/fonts`, so bundle that folder with any release builds.
